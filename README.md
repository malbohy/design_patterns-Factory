 Creational Design Patterns

Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

in other words: <br/>
if you have more than object type , and all of them confirm to same interface , 
but you need each one according to some values comes to you from the user , you can get the needed object according to the user input <br/>

like the example here if the user entered sms , you have an object that deals with sms notifications , and if he/she entered email you have the object that deals with email notifications
